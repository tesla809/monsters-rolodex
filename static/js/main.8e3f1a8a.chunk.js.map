Only when the event is fired off.\n\nEvents - \nReact has Synthetic Events that allows\nyou to use events across different browsers\nwith out manual configuration.\n\nReact normalizes events so that \nthey have consistent properties \nacross different browsers.\n\nSynthetic event tells the app\nsomething happened and it allows it \nto react to it and update the state.\n\nThey are also camel cased.\n\n`this` keyword - \nReference the instance of the class.\n\n`this` gets bounded differently \ndepending on how we define the class method.\n\nMethods in classes\nLifecycle methods are bounded already\nsince they are inherited from the React.Component class\nTo bound our methods we need to reference them\nin the constructor.\n\nTo do so, we `.bind()` our function \nto the context of this\nie, our current component in the constructor.\n\nOr we can do it another way\nsetting the context in the function definition\ninside the class with an arrow function.\nSee handleChange as an example\nhandleChange = (e) => {...}\n\nArrow functions get lexical scoping, \nhaving their `this` bounded to the place \nthey were defined in, ie this class.\n\nGood rule of thumb is this: \nUse arrow functions on any class methods \nyou define and aren't part of React \n(i.e. render(), componentDidMount()). \n*/\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
